## Architecture

![architecture](architecture.png)
---

## EC2 Deployment

* Hosted on **AWS EC2 Free Tier**
* Docker + Docker Compose for infrastructure
* SSH-based CI/CD with `deploy.sh`
* No HTTPS due to lack of custom domain (microphone access limitations acknowledged)

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

* GitHub Actions pushes to `main`
* Auto-deploys via `ssh` + `deploy.sh`:

  * Pulls latest changes
  * Rebuilds and restarts containers
  * Logs any failures

---

## Engineering Tradeoffs

*  **No React** – UI built using plain **HTML + TailwindCDN + JavaScript**
*  Prompts written with a therapeutic tone — drawing from ACT, CBT, and journaling practices
*  Prompt rotation stored locally (`prompt_tracker.json`) – not Git-tracked
*  **FastAPI** used for async capability and readable API structure
*  Focused MVP – scoped to two roles with minimal dependencies

---

## Testing

* **Manual test coverage:**

  * Analyze endpoint (edge cases + normal entries)
  * Prompt rotation
  * Therapist feedback flow
* Early unit tests added in `/tests` (e.g., prompt reuse, short-entry check)

---

## Future Plans

*  **HTTPS support** via Let's Encrypt (once domain is set up)
*  Mobile-responsive redesign
*  Emotion graphing over time
*  Therapist onboarding + OTP login
*  Suggestion engine for therapist feedback
*  Local offline journaling fallback
